Amazon Clone - Front-End (HTML & CSS)

This repository contains the front-end code for a basic clone of the Amazon website, built using HTML and CSS.

Project Overview

This project aims to provide a foundation for practicing front-end development skills by replicating the visual layout of Amazon's main page. It focuses on:

Structuring the page using HTML elements (headings, paragraphs, lists, images, etc.)
Applying CSS styles to achieve a similar look and feel to the original Amazon website (navigation bar, search bar, product listings, etc.)

Feel free to fork this repository and make your own contributions. You can improve the HTML structure, enhance the CSS styles, or add basic JavaScript functionality (optional) to make the clone more interactive.


Additional Notes

This is a basic front-end clone; it does not include any back-end functionality or shopping cart features.
You can customize the CSS styles to further match Amazon's design or create your own unique style.
Consider exploring basic JavaScript if you want to add interactivity (e.g., drop-down menus, search functionality).
If you use any external resources (e.g., fonts), be sure to include them in the project directory or link to them appropriately.
Happy Coding!
